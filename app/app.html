Around the forehead, cheeks, and upper face, use sharp, directionally varied linework to create depth, tension, and volume. The fur must be ruffled and messy. Add scattered stray hairs escaping from the silhouette. The ears must be upright, expressive, slightly angled outward, with the inner fur drawn using lighter gray strokes for contrast.
Use directional lighting that illuminates the raccoon from the front, creating strong depth in the facial features and highlighting the layered fur texture while leaving some outer edges darker for dramatic contrast.

The fur must be well groomed, not messy, not ruffled, feel rich, heavy, and realistic in its stylization—created through many overlapping strokes, each with visible directionality and tension. Around the forehead, cheeks, and upper face, use sharper, more angular lines to build volume and depth; around the neck and chest, use longer, flowing strokes that form a soft downward cascade. The fur should show high contrast: deep shadow planes merging into the black background, and brilliant white highlights defining areas touched by overhead light.

The raccoon’s iconic facial mask must be clearly defined but fully consistent with the chosen palette: very dark, nearly black fur around the eyes transitioning into lighter steel-gray and silver fur along the cheeks and muzzle. The muzzle must be short, dense, and bright white with subtle gray shadows shaping the contours.

The raccoon must stand out through contrast.

The final image must feel carefully crafted, expressive, and rich in texture, with every stroke contributing to a premium, high-detail image."

The background and surrounding environment must be set as a cinematic high contrast forest scene captured at early sunrise. The composition shows a dense, mature woodland filled with tall trees, primarily oaks and pines, with thick dark trunks rising vertically and disappearing into a layered canopy of deep green leaves. The atmosphere is humid and slightly misty, giving the entire scene a soft, dreamlike quality.

Golden morning sunlight breaks through the canopy in long, diagonal beams, cutting through the haze. These radiant sunbeams illuminate floating dust particles and create warm glowing streaks that contrast against the cool shadows of the forest. The backlighting creates strong silhouettes of branches, leaves, and tree trunks, emphasizing depth and complexity in the composition.

In the foreground, lush green undergrowth spreads across the forest floor: dense clusters of leafy plants, low shrubs, scattered ferns, and patches of moist grass. The vegetation is uneven, natural, and slightly wild. Sunlight touches some leaves, making them shimmer with soft, warm highlights, while other areas remain in deep, cool shadow.

The forest floor is textured with soil, small plants, scattered leaves, and subtle variations in height. No clear path is visible—just a natural blending of light and shadow across the ground. Midground trees form a semi-silhouetted wall that catches faint rim light around their edges, while the background fades into atmospheric haze.

The overall mood is peaceful, serene, slightly magical, and cinematic. The color palette is dominated by natural forest greens, cool shadowed blues, and soft golden sunrise tones. The lighting is the main dramatic element, creating a sense of calm wonder and quiet morning beauty."

The background and surrounding environment must be set as a night-time forest scene illuminated only by cold moonlight. The setting is a deep, dense coniferous forest with towering pine and spruce trees rising high on both sides of a narrow forest path. The camera angle is positioned low, close to the wet ground of the pathway, capturing the texture of damp soil, scattered pine needles, and faint reflective puddles of water. The ground must look moist, uneven, and natural, with subtle glistening highlights caused by moonlight reflecting off wet surfaces.

The entire atmosphere must be cold, foggy, mysterious, and filled with deep shadows. The color palette is dominated by dark blue, charcoal grey, black-green, misty cyan, and subtle silver moonlight tones. No warm colors should be present.

The moon is partially veiled behind branches high in the sky and serves as the single light source. Soft, diffused moonlight breaks through the silhouettes of the treetops, creating delicate beams and hazy shafts of light. These beams illuminate patches of fog, suspended moisture, and swirling mist drifting close to the forest floor. The fog must appear ethereal, pale, and ghost-like, wrapping gently around tree trunks, roots, and bushes in the distance.

The trees must be extremely tall and slender, with thick, dark trunks, rough bark texture, and dense overlapping canopies that block most of the sky. The treetops form a tunnel-like ceiling over the path, adding depth and a sense of isolation. Branches and needles merge into heavy shadow masses, leaving only the edges caught by faint moonlight.

Along the path edges, include small young pines and thin shrub silhouettes, partially concealed in fog. Some should appear almost transparent due to the thick atmospheric haze. Background objects must gradually fade into darkness, creating strong depth and a cinematic gradient from sharp foreground detail to blurred distant shapes.

The mood must be eerie, calm, hauntingly beautiful, and cinematic. Include faint ghostly light patches in distant fog pockets, creating a subtle supernatural hint without revealing any clear figures. The entire scene should feel like a still frame from a high-budget dark fantasy film."

The background and surrounding environment must be set as a classic bright yellow Volkswagen Type 2 van driving down a wide city street on a clear, sunny day. The perspective must be frontal and low-angle, placing the viewer directly in front of the van as it moves forward. The windshield must be completely empty inside — no driver, no passengers, no silhouettes, no reflections of people. The interior should appear clean, quiet, and softly shadowed, with dark tinted glass preventing any specific interior details from becoming visible.

The body of the van must have saturated, warm yellow paint with subtle gradients, sharp highlights, and soft shadows defining its rounded nostalgic shape. Include authentic details: chrome bumper, round headlights with reflective gloss, the classic VW emblem, turn signals, windshield wipers, and a black license plate with white characters. Add small signs of wear such as tiny scratches, faint edge chips, and subtle paint scuffs for realism, but keep the overall condition vibrant and well-maintained.

Show a dynamic street environment with two rows of mid-rise city buildings receding into the distance, using clean outlines and pastel-toned facades. Windows, fire escapes, storefronts, and trees should be simplified but recognizable. The motion of the van must be expressed through long, stylized road-line streaks and slightly stretched shadows under the vehicle. Include several parked cars along the street, drawn in the same illustrative style.

The sky must feature a huge, dramatic, towering cloud formation — soft, puffy, and painted with creamy whites and pale warm tones, rising high above the buildings like a massive cotton structure. The sky behind it should be a deep, saturated turquoise-blue, enhancing the retro graphic atmosphere.

Lighting should be bright and natural, casting soft midday shadows on the street and creating glossy reflections on the van’s curved surfaces. Maintain a cheerful, adventurous mood with a hint of surreal whimsy created by the empty driver's seat."

Camera must be positioned low, close to the ground, with a visible foreground area creating strong down-right bokeh and deep distance to the raccoon. Add softly blurred ground elements in the extreme foreground to create a well-seen shallow down-right bokeh, while the mid-ground surface remains slightly more detailed.

Enormous amount of mixed countless tiny warm glowing dust along with multicolored particles of detailed broken glass, sparkling crystals as a dense, cumulus wave-wall must rise naturally from the soil behind the raccoon. Distribute glowing dust, sparkling crystals and colored glass irregularly wide-spread throughout the space: more dense, bright and larger near the ground, gradually fewer, smaller and dimmer toward the upper part of the scene. Avoid making a pillar or a column out of the particles, glass or glowing dust, instead spread it dense widely. All soil, colored glass and glowing dust particles must follow only warm tones — bronze, little golden, amber, copper and soft white — with natural brightness variation. No cool or blue particles.

Behind the risen particles or crystals add a small blue nebula.
Ensure the very upper portion of the background remains very dark with minimal dust, suggesting depth and atmospheric darkness.

Make an empty mid-ground area centered in the frame and place a raccoon there in any position. The lighting on the ground and floating particles must feel naturally consistent with a character positioned there.

Maintain a contrast between the glowing dust and the surrounding darkness."

The background and surrounding environment must be set as a winter night village scene, inspired by traditional European architecture. The composition shows a cozy snowy street stretching into the distance, framed by old wooden houses with steep triangular roofs, all decorated with warm golden Christmas lights. The buildings feature ornate timber framing, frosted windows glowing from soft interior lighting, and small festive details such as garlands, wreaths, pine branches, ribbons, and candlelit lanterns.

Camera must be positioned low, close to the ground, with a visible foreground area creating strong bokeh and deep distance to the raccoon. Add softly blurred snow in the extreme foreground to create a well-seen shallow bokeh, while the mid-ground surface remains slightly more detailed. Lightly scatter a dusting of fresh snow on the raccoon’s fur.

The entire street is covered with thick, uneven snow, showing deep wagon tracks and soft footprints that create realistic texture and depth. The snow surface reflects warm light from the windows, producing gentle golden highlights alongside cold bluish shadows from the moonlight. Tiny sparkles of fresh snow glitter across the ground, giving a magical fairytale effect. A wooden fence partially covered in snow appears near the right foreground.

A large, beautifully decorated Christmas tree stands prominently on the right side of the image, covered in shimmering ornaments, glowing garlands, and sparkling lights that cast a radiant warm glow onto the surrounding snow. Small light flares and bokeh sparkles float around the tree, enhancing the festive mood.

The sky is a breathtaking night scene filled with countless glowing stars and softly falling snowflakes. A bright full moon hangs high above, illuminating the village with a cold mystical light, casting a silvery glow on the rooftops and treetops. Behind the moon, dramatic clouds drift through the dark blue sky, creating a dreamy, enchanted atmosphere. Snowflakes are varied in size and shape, some crisp and sharp in the foreground, others softly blurred to capture motion and depth.

Tall, leafless winter trees line the edges of the composition, their branches covered lightly in snow and reflecting both warm lights from the houses and cold light from the moon. The overall ambiance is cozy yet majestic — a perfectly peaceful winter holiday scene with cinematic depth of field, high-dynamic range lighting, ultra-realistic shadows, volumetric glow, and soft atmospheric haze.

Add illumination from all light sources, subtle subsurface scattering in snow, and magical Christmas atmosphere in every element."
